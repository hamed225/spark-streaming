# spark-streaming
A large air quality dataset of India is streamed using apache kafka and apache spark structured streaming and ml library is used for applying machine learning on the streamed data. The code is entirely in python language.
  The air quality dataset is taken from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/sohelranaccselab/air-quality-data-in-india-2015-2020?select=city_hour.csv. The ultimate aim of this project is to use apache kafka to fetch the data and feed to spark engiene. On top of that machine learning is applied on spark side to predict the quality of air.
  Initially the dataset is cleaned and the final column is converted from categorical to numerical( good, satisfactory are converted to 1 and severe, poor, very poor converted to 0). Now this dataset is given to kafka producer. Kafka producer converts csv file to json format and stores the produced data in kafka topic. Now the spark(kafka consumer) creates a session and reads the stream from the kafka topic and converts to json object type. Now, ml library is used to apply machine learning. Logistic regression is used to classify the air quality and finally the stream batches along with the prediction are displayed in the console.
